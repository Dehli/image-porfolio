	<div>I have always loved the warm comfortable beauty that God has given to natural wood. I am a practicing Family Physician, and during my professional career, I have continued to be drawn to the solitude and creativity of working with wood as a venue for my relaxation.I am grateful to be learning and experimenting with each new creation. It is very satisfying for me to transform a rough block of wood into a smooth fluid filled motion. I use curves and contrasting materials to express my feelings, surroundings and experiences that I have been blessed with. I am honored to share my work with you. Thank you for looking.
