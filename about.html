		I have always loved the warm comfortable beauty that God has given to natural wood. 
		I am a practicing Family Physician, and during my professional career, I have continued 
		to be drawn to the solitude and creativity of working with wood as a venue for my relaxation.
		I am grateful to be learning and experimenting with each new creation. It is very satisfying 
		for me to transform a rough block of wood into a smooth fluid filled motion. I use curves 
		and contrasting materials to express my feelings, surroundings and experiences that I have 
		been blessed with. I am honored to share my work with you.
